TalkJS Example: User to Operator
================================

This example showcases a situation with two user types:
* an operator (or a group of operators working from a single account) who works for your company
* users of your product, who can receive guidance from operators.

Unlike helpdesk popup widgets, TalkJS lets you embed the chatbox right inside the page, which is what this example showcases.
